* It’s been 30 years since the World Wide Web was invented by *Tim Berners-Lee*. 
* In March of 1989 he introduced a document called “Information Management: A Proposal”, which would eventually become the Internet.
* The London based computer scientist also wrote the three essential technologies that are still largely considered the foundation of the modern-day internet: **HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Uniform Resource Identifier (UFI), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**. 

* But first let’s answer a few basic questions to get a better understanding of the modern-day web browser.
1. **What is a web browser?**
* Simply put, a web browser is an application used to access websites. Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
2. **How do web browsers work?**
*  Web browser’s primary utility is to render HTML – the code that is used in web design and to mark-up web pages. The process begins when you input a website’s URL into the address bar of your browser. Your browser will then work to locate and request the website page’s information from its web server. The browser receives the file which informs it on how to display the information on the web page. Your browser will then interpret the file and display the page for you – as the user, to read and interact with.

# The Browser Wars

The browser war, primarily between the two major players *Microsoft* and *Netscape*, heats up. 

## Mosaic
*	In 1992 there were only 50 web pages on the Internet.
*	In 1993, at the University of Illinois by the age of 22, the student named *Marc Andreessen* created **“Mosaic Browser”** and later commercialized by **Netscape** that enabled the access to the World Wide Web and therefore made it a lot easier for people to get access to content.
*	The fall of 1993 the Illinois geeks posted **“Mosaic Browser”** online and made it a freely downloadable gift to humanity and what a gift it turned out to be well.

## Netscape Navigator
*	*Professors Jim Clark*, Co-founder of **Netscape** became the partner with *Marc Andreessen* and lanuch new Application in *13th of October 1994* called **Navigator**.
*	The **Netscape web browser** is the general name for a series of web browsers formerly produced by *Netscape Communications Corporation*, a former subsidiary of AOL.
*	We have never seen anything like this in the history of software in 30 days, 90% of the people who are on the web switched from mosaic to Netscape that just doesn't happen in software when Netscape got a million downloads.
