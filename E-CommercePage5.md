* We are taking part in a noble tradition the evolution of capitalism but now a new face of capitalism is upon us the age of e-commerce. 
* Electronic commerce, or E-commerce , refers to buying and selling products and services on the Internet.
* An age that changes the way the business works the way we buy and sell an age assured in by a transformative technology the world wide web and by two of its seminal companies **amazon.com** and **eBay**. It is easy to forget just how revolutionary these companies were when they first burst upon the scene back in the 1990s how they shook big business to its very core.
* By 2017, the e-commerce industry had grown to over $2.3 trillion dollars. By 2021, the e-commerce market is expected to be worth nearly $4.89 trillion. E-commerce has come a long way from its humble beginnings. 
 
**Why E-commerce?**

* The quick and easy access made e-commerce the preferred way of doing business today. Compared to physical stores, an extensive product database can easily be sifted through by customers without the need to leave the house.
*  E-commerce  can happen in many forms, like ordering goods, purchasing a service, buying a subscription to an information source, or even setting up an online bill-paying schedule. It has deeply affected everyday life and how business and governments operate.
* With massive amounts of information available—including options, competitive prices, and testimonials from other buyers—customers who shop online have virtually everything they need to make a buying decision. They can even make the purchase right away if they want to.

## The Origins of E-commerce

* Before Amazon came along, in 1979 **Michael Aldrich** was laying the groundwork for e-commerce as we know it. Based out of the United Kingdom, Aldrich modified a TV and used a telephone line to connect it to a multi-user transaction processing computer.
* On August 11, 1994, The New York Times reported that a man named Phil Brandenberger from Philadelphia purchased a Sting album from his computer. This opened up a staggering opportunity for innovative entrepreneurs to capitalize on this emerging trend. With the advent of Amazon and eBay the following year, it’s an understatement to say that the pace of e-commerce sped up soon after.
* In 1992, one of the first e-commerce sites, Book Stacks Unlimited, was opened by **Charles M. Stack**. It became **Books.com** in 1994, and eventually became part of **Barnes & Noble**.
* In 1997, Dell became the first company to have an online sales record of $1 million.

## A TALE OF TWO TITANS: AMAZON, EBAY AND MODERN E-COMMERCE

* An age that changes the way the business works the way we buy and sell an age assured in by a transformative technology the world wide web and by two of its seminal companies amazon.com and eBay. It is easy to forget just how revolutionary these companies were when they first burst upon the scene back in the 1990s how they shook big business to its very core.
* Now amazon and eBay are creating a whole new model of commerce one based on taking the internet and harnessing the power of the great mass of individuals down here at street level.

### Amazon Destined to Be the King of the Jungle

* In terms of revenue and marketing capitalization, **Amazon** is now the largest e-commerce company in the world. The tech behemoth was founded in 1994 by **Jeff Bezos** and initially focused on selling books. While Amazon now dominates much of downtown Seattle, it was first based out of Bezo’s garage in Bellevue.
* These days, Amazon is an “A to Z” retailer, offering a huge range of physical and digital products. **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is also one of the largest cloud server companies in the world.
* Amazon goes public at $18 per share, giving it a valuation of $300 million. In 2021, Amazon stock price is $3,350 per share with Market cap of $1.69T.
* Time Magazine names Bezos Person of the Year, dubbing him "the king of cybercommerce." At age 35, Bezos is the fourth-youngest recipient of the distinction.
*	Amazon did that we need to delve in to the age-old science of encryption powerful methods of scrambling messages mathematically had been developed long ago and employed most famously during World War II but it was clear that something much more sophisticated was needed for the new digital age the old method needed an upgrade because there was a fatal flaw.
*	The plan came from a trio of California-based mathematicians named Whitfield Diffie, Martin Hellman and Ralph Merkle we developed something called public key cryptography their scheme turned how encryption had been done for centuries on its head.

### eBay Made E-Commerce Easy

* Amazon wasn’t the only e-commerce giant to emerge in the mid-1990s. In 1995, **Pierre Omidyar** founded **eBay** in his living room. Rather than selling goods directly, Omidyar built a bidding platform that would allow people to sell and buy products from one another.
* eBay and similar websites made it easy for people who didn’t have tech/web development skills to sell goods online. Even small businesses and individuals could quickly sell goods through eBay. Soon, countless people were making a living through e-commerce.
* In the beginning Pierre Omidyar and Jeff Bezos shared one thing in common they thought of the web as a place to do business and not just goof around the part from that. Pierre was from Venus and Jeff is from Mars they couldn't have been more different where Jeff was about the business plan the market research the methodical analysis while Pierre well he didn't have a business plan he hadn't done any market research he was just a humble software coder who thought that the idea of making an online auction site sounded pretty cool it was an idea that he could take care of all by himself tapping away at his home computer.
* IPO windows open for eBay the company sailed right through it with an offering that was a success beyond anyone's expectations eBay's stocks soared that first day by the end of it the company was now valued at more than two million dollars the issue was priced at $18 a share.

## The Dot-Come Bubble Pops

* By the late 1990s, E-Commerce was booming. Emerging companies were selling pretty much everything you could think of. And investors assumed that the Internet was the next big thing. This led to a sort of “gold rush” with investors pouring huge amounts of money into web-based companies.
* In turn, this created a bubble as investors became highly speculative, pushing the value of web companies up to unsustainable levels. In 2000, the dot-com bubble burst.
* Numerous companies quickly folded and the industry went through a period of consolidation. Amazon, eBay, and others survived. However, many smaller companies were either bought out or failed.
* Although it would survive the dot-com crash, Amazon wasn't totally immune. Its stock peaked at nearly $106 a share at the end of 1999, before taking a long slide, pummeled by negative analyst reports. The company would lay off 15% of its workforce before the stock price recovered.
