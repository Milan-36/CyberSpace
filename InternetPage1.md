# Internet


*	Internet is a source of information. It is a global wide area network that connects millions of people with their personal computers to communicate with each other across the world. 
*	It is a tangible physical system made to move information from one node to another.
*	Internet is not owned by anyone and on the same time it is also owned by everyone. It is made of independently operated Network.
*	Computer scientists Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn are credited with inventing the Internet communication in 1960’s.
*	This is the age of Internet, or we can say a global network of communication that turn 21st century people around the world to exchange messages, finding information free and even tyranny computer communication can also be a tool of war to manage material and manpower.

## Advantages & Disadvantages of the Internet

| **Pros**                                                | **Cons**                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Allows to stay connected with people all over the globe | Unhealthy level of dependence on technology   |
| Improvement in information flows                        | Privacy issues & Cyber bullying               |
| Automation                                              | Children Are Vulnerable and Exposed           |
| Necessary for the progress in artificial intelligence   | Artificial intelligence could become a danger |


# ARPA

* During the cold war in October 1957 the Soviet Union USSR launched “Sputnik space satellite” into space and, with it, global communications and made a progress in space technology.
* After seeing USSR making progress in space technology, American President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the bureau at the Défense Department called **ARPA the Advanced Research Projects Agency in 1958**, it oversaw the space program which then included computer science but when the space program got its own agency NASA computer research fell into relative obscurity America turned its attention to conquering the Stars and beating the Russians in space.
* **J.C.R. Licklider** writes memos about his Intergalactic Network concept of networked computers and becomes the first head of the computer research program at ARPA.

# TCP/IP

* Development begins on what will eventually be called **TCP/IP protocol** by a group headed by **Vint Cerf (Stanford) and Robert Kahn (DARPA)**. The new protocol will allow diverse computer networks to interconnect and communicate with each other.

* **ARPAnet Transitions to TCP/IP :** The ARPAnet changes its core networking protocols from Network Control Programs to the more flexible and powerful TCP/IP protocol suite, marking the start of the modern Internet.

# WWW

* At CERN, the European Physical Laboratory, **Tim Berners-Lee** creates the World Wide Web.
