# The History of Network Technology
* Computer networking is one of the best breakthroughs of our age. Before the Internet took over our daily lives, engineers and scientists worked to connect computers to each other.The work they did established our current state of networking.
* While America gave a birth to space technology, The MIT graduate student named **Leonard Kleinrock** also known as “Father of the Internet” began applying queueing theory to data transmission. Queueing theory is a fantastic tool for evaluating computer and communication systems. Queue is a quite simple structure; it is simply a system to which you arrive hang around a while and leave like letters going through post offices.
* Kleinrock showed how packages of data would queue or line up at the nodes of communication network as they transit.
*	ARPANET revolutionized communications by using **packet-switching** instead of direct connections.
*	The history of modern computer and device networking goes back to 1969, when ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) became the first connected computer network. It implemented the TCP/IP protocol suite, which later became the Internet.
*	ARPANET revolutionized communications by using **packet-switching** instead of direct connections.
*	The legendary app **EMAIL**, Raymond Tomlinson was actually working on a email program for a single computer so that one could send messages from oneself to another user.
* At CERN, the European Physical Laboratory, **Tim Berners-Lee** creates the World Wide Web.

## Network packet switching
* Back in early 60s when Soviet attacks Americans and destroyed the telephone system and the American military would be unable to launch a counterattack.
* **Paul Baran** builds fishnet type network like a distributed network, so that if line is break then it could find its path through the network. This invention is called “hot potato routing”, data is chop in little piece and send in network.
* In this new network new problems are arising like where to send data. And how data packets knows when to stop. So, Paul Baran adapts the idea of Shannon of mouse maze theory. He chops up each message into small equal sized pieces called packets. And each packet contains where the packets go and a from address in their header. Then it launches that packet into the network, and it goes to one node to another node and take different paths but no dedicated path is constantly available for them packets.
* All the packets will find their way along pairs that are available in the network. This is how Network packet switching technique was created.
* In packet switching network, Node keeps a copy of a packet until it successfully arrives at another node or Its destination node. So if there’s a packets lost occurs, the network still can retrieve the packet from last node.
* **Lawrence Roberts** (MIT) and **Thomas Marill** get an ARPA contract to create the first **wide-area network** (WAN) connection via long distant dial-up between a TX-2 computer in Massachusetts and a Q-32 computer in California. The system confirms that packet switching offers the most promising model for communication between computers.

## IMP

* In 1966, **Bob Taylor** of ARPA and **Larry Roberts** built the world's first experimental connection between two computers at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington Massachusetts.
* When Robert dealing with different kinds of computer, he figures out a way to connect the computer by building identical special purpose minicomputer to form the network and tie each time-shared computer to one another and it was going to be based on special purpose minicomputers called **Interface Message Processors** or IMPs and a revolutionary technology called packet switching.
* **Stephen Crocker** wrote the code to join UCLA's computer to the first IMPs and was success of having one computer send a program over to another computer.
* Steve Crocker heads UCLA Network Working Group under Professor Leonard Kleinrock to develop host level protocols for ARPAnet communication in preparation for becoming the first node.  The group, which includes Vint Cerf and Jon Postel, lays the foundation for protocols of the modern Internet.

## EMAIL

* **Raymond Tomlinson** was a pioneering American computer programmer who implemented the first email program on the ARPANET system in 1971. It was the first system able to send mail between users on different hosts connected to ARPANET.
* Tomlinson did more than just write the code for email in a keystroke he gave the world a new icon for the Information Age the **“@”** sign. 
* It is saying for the ARPANET that they went from remote login to file transfer to electronic mail in a year flat or two years flat and then it stayed that way for 20 years.

## TCP/ IP
* Vinton Cerf and Robert Elliot Kahn (Bob Kahn) teamed up to develop a set of rules or procedures known as the TCP/IP protocol in 1973 that if followed by different computer networks would allow them to pass their message packets back and forth and thus be able to communicate across networks called the Gateway.
* Finally in 1983 after ten years of refinement and bureaucratic haggling TCP/IP protocol was adopted as the universal standard marking a milestone in the development of the Internet a common network of interconnected networks.
* **ARPAnet Transitions to TCP/IP** : The ARPAnet changes its core networking protocols from Network Control Programs to the more flexible and powerful TCP/IP protocol suite, marking the start of the modern Internet.

## WWW
* In early 90’s, **Tim Berners Lee**, the inventor of World Wide Web. He developed the software to follow threads of knowledge more easily within the information stored throughout the internet.
