*	The history of modern computer and device networking goes back to 1969, when ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) became the first connected computer network. It implemented the TCP/IP protocol suite, which later became the Internet.
*	Computer networking is one of the best breakthroughs of our age. Before the Internet took over our daily lives, engineers and scientists worked to connect computers to each other.The work they did established our current state of networking.
*	ARPANET revolutionized communications by using **packet-switching** instead of direct connections.
*	The legendary app **EMAIL**, Raymond Tomlinson was actually working on a email program for a single computer so that one could send messages from oneself to another user.
* At CERN, the European Physical Laboratory, **Tim Berners-Lee** creates the World Wide Web.
