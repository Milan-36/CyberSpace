## 1990 - Birth of Search Engines

* **Search Engines** play an integral role in the lives of many of us, sometimes without us realising.
* A purchase on *Amazon*, usually starts with a product search. A new vacation booking, often begins with a hotel search. The answer to any question, is just a *web search* away.
* The goal of all search engines is to find and organize distributed data found on the Internet. 
* Before search engines were developed, the Internet was a collection of *File Transfer Protocol (FTP)* sites in which users would navigate to find specific shared files. As the central list of web servers joining the Internet grew, and the *World Wide Web* became the interface of choice for accessing the Internet, the need for finding and organizing the distributed data files on FTP web servers grew. 
* **Search engines** began due to this need to more easily navigate the web servers and files on the Internet.
* The first search engine was developed as a school project by *Alan Emtage*, a student at McGill University in Montreal in *1990*, called **Archie**.
* In *1991*, *Mark McCahill*, a student at the University of Minnesota, effectively used a hypertext paradigm to create **Gopher**, which also searched for plain text references in files.
* Another significant development in search engines came in *1994* when **WebCrawler’s Search Engine** began indexing the full text of web sites instead of just web page titles.

*  **Excite** is another search engine and was start-up by another bunch of Stanford student name **Joe Kraus** and his friends in *1993*.
*	Excite developed was considerably more sophisticated than that developed by Yahoo rather than a list of sites compiled and sorted into categories by human beings excite was pure software when you type in your query the service would crawl the web finding pages that contain the term, you would enter it was that is a rudimentary version of what we think of as search today.

## Yahoo! - Born in 1994 and lanuch in 1995

*	A couple of slackers named *Jerry Yang and David Fowler* of Stanford university were goofing around and they hit on an idea that would become the basis for one of America's best-known businesses and turn them into billionaires today their company is called **Yahoo** established in *1994* and it is among the most trafficked sites on the web.
*	It was incredibly crude compiled manually by a pair of geeks who spent hours looking at as many websites as possible than deciding how to list them crude or not though, but the guys called **“Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web”** was the first thing of its kind and it proved immensely popular literally overnight. The guys soon realized they needed a shorter snappier punchier name one that sounded kind of you know exciting yeah **“yah-hoo”** was a great idea.
* **Michael Moritz** the venture capitalists invested two million dollars in Yang and Fowler’s website, but it was a gamble based on little more than a hunch the large numbers of people visited the Yahoo site.
* In mid-90’s venture capitalists and other financial types who figure that the internet was a new kind of medium and media had always been supported by advertising.
*	Late in 1995, Yahoo began taking *banner ads* then held their breath and crossed their fingers with some trepidation that when they put up our first advertising. For the first time yahoo had shown it was possible to make money on the web it was a crucial moment in the story, and it meant one thing the web boom had begun it was almost like a starting gun went off.

## Lycos - Born in 1994 and lanuch in 1995

* **Lycos search engine** also launched in 1994. The search engine cataloged over 394,000 documents by August. By January 1995, they had over 1.5 million documents cataloged.

### Drawbacks of Yahoo! and Excite Search Engine

* The race by 1996, Yahoo faced an assortment of challengers they were gaining ground on it Infoseek, AltaVista, Lycos but Yahoo's most formidable rival was a company called Excite.
*	Major sit back ups when information on the web Yahoo or Excite and the rest of the so-called search companies frankly stunk you can spend all day typing in various combinations of words to find what you are looking for and still come up empty most of the results, you would receive were links to sites trying to sell you something you didn't want.

* In 1998, Once again from Stanford two young geeks *Larry Page and Sergey Brin* came with new search engine and the name of the company was unrepentantly goofy **Google**, a twist on the word Google a mathematical term for 10 to the hundredth power.
* The **Google page** that we're also familiar with by now here's the white box where you type in your query here are the untainted results generated by the Google relevance algorithm and then here at the top to the right are the ads blue coloured sponsored links that companies have paid for and it's from these that Google has derived billions in profits over the past few years it was clear that it was a better user experience.
* Google generates most of its revenues from advertising.

* **MSN** Search launched in *1998* in the wake of Google when Microsoft’s Windows operating system was used by over 90% of Americans.
* MSN initially used *Inktomi* search results, which also powered Yahoo.
